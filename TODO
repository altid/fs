Can read stats for list of servers, etc
Clone, get your n back
/mnt/altid/1/ctl, write which service to connect to
the fs populates with that, you can read in tabs to see what buffers are available

Commands:
 - markup, will need to import the state machine parser to pre-parse the output into just text
 - tabs could be a command?

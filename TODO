## Client

### Brief overview

```
#!/bin/rc

# Example /bin/rc/service/tcp18111
mount '#s/libera' /mnt/irc
exec /bin/exportfs -r /mnt/irc
```

Connects with aname = desired buffer, or gets just whichever is first (usually a `server`, but just in added-order)
 - if no buffers exist, exit error. We don't support hung states!

### TODO: 

- Add in command to toggle markup
- Blocking reads for feed, potentially a cb to clear out unread counts

## Service

### Brief overview 

- service reads from /mnt/alt/clone to get n
- service will write the service name to `/mnt/alt/n/ctl`
	- If a service exists in /srv by that name, an error will be returned. rm the service first!
	- If the name is not valid filechars, an error will be returned (this is used in /srv, after all)
	- the service reads and writes to the returned fd until it closes, signalling completion

### TODO

- Add a stats/info file to root of /mnt/alt

## Notifications:

- Create and update them, integrate with tabs
- Install fmt for printing

## Tabs:

- list available buffers with unread counts, add notify `!` when applicable
- Install fmt for printing
